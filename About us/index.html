            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <p>
              Because our primary product is BQSAFEWASH Imagine having a healthy
              baby and having to be admitted back to the hospital few days after
              child birth due to escalated skin irritation(Dermatitis) as a
              result of using poorly formulated laundry detergent. This was our
              founder's experience with her son in 2019. <br />
              As a mother, who has witnessed first hand the dangers of using
              regular laundry detergent for her baby, and also the several
              bitter complaints of parents on motherhood platforms, she was
              moved to research as a pharmacologist, and this lead to the
              innovation of BQSAFEWASH, a liquid laundry detergent specifically
              formulated for babies and children of African decent. <br />
              As we grew, we saw the need for equally efficient and safe liquid
              detergent for everyday use, and we got to work, formulating our
              highly effective anti-bacterial BQ Hand Wash to take care of your
              hands and our deep grease cutting BQ Utensil Wash, to take care of
              your dishes as your kitchen cleaning expert. <br />

            <h4>Who We Are</h4>
            <p class="text">
              BQ GLOBAL SOLUTIONS LIMITED is an innovative detergent company
              with a primary product called BQ SAFE WASH Laundry Detergent; a
              healthy liquid laundry detergent, specifically formulated for
              babies and children with great concern for the African child.
              Having in mind the daily increase in the percentage of children
              cancer patients worldwide, skin reactions caused by harmful
              chemicals, high priced soaps leading to parents using products not
              ideal for their children. With our knowledge and expertise, we
              have been able to provide the most efficient, effective and
              environmentally friendly laundry solution for every home. <br />
              <br />
              In addition, we recently launched our other BQPRODUCTS that are
              for everyday use but equally effective and environmentally
              friendly.
