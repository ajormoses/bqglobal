          <h2>1. Can Bqsafewash be used on adult clothings?</h2>

          <p>
            Yes, although the liquid wash is specifically formulated for babies
            and children, adults too can use it. <br />
            See it this way, if it doesn't harm your child then it's good for
            you too.
          </p>

            fade and doesn't irritate the skin.
